              <p>

                decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality metaverse powered by the ethereum blockchain
                within the decentraland users can create experiences and monetize their contents and applications

                <br>this is one of the closest aspects of what a metaverse will end up looking like here
                in the future

                the decentralad has been existing for years now

                and it is pretty close to what meta is visioning in this online world there is a ton of different
                experiences that users can participate and play

                decentraland is considered as the og of the metaverse on blockchain they have been building and
                existing for years now

                and a lot of people are starting to enter this online world we can see that this metaverse is
                building to a more realistic 3D virtual reality

                and the graphics the avatars the items the building structures and many other things within the game
                look a lot more realistic

                <br>before we do end off this blog I want to give some of my final thoughts on this decentraland
                metaverse
                the decentraland right now is definitely the leading metaverse on the
                blockchain

                at the moment it is by far the most recognizable and has been building out for years
                the game has been active and people have been able to play this game

                this metaverse for quite some time now and a lot of the nft ogs that came from this base also came from
                the decentraland as well that's how long this has been building for

                ! think the decentraland definitely has a promising
                future ahead of itself


              </p>

          <div class="grdis-about-inf">
            <div class="one-left-ab">

              <p>land inside decentraland is a non-fungible digital asset an nft maintained in an ethereum
                smart contract

                each land token includes a record of its coordinates its owner and a reference to the
                content description <br>

                file plots of land are able to host different experiences games and interactions within
                this metaverse there is a total of 90601 parcels of land in the decentraland

                and there are two different types of land we have one by one land and then estates <br>

                now one by one plots of land is very simple it's just one single plot of land and the
                state is an association of two or more directly adjacent parcels of land



                so if two one by one plots are together and you both own those plots it could become an
                estate now

                <br>let's talk about the dimensions of a single plot of land <br>



                land parcels are 16 meters by 16 meters or 52 feet by 52 feet and this should give you
                an accurate estimation of how large these pieces of land are within this metaverse




                now as we stated these pieces of land are nfts right non-fungible tokens which verify
                your digital ownership of that piece of land

                and with this nft not only do you get verification that this is your plot of land
                you're able to create different experiences on top of it
                land is arguably the most crucial thing for these types of metaverses

                all of the content experiences games different activities that are being able to be
                played out into decentraland will have to be hosted on plots of land
              </p>

          <h3 class="hny-title">Value factors of Decentraland land property<span class="dot-1">.</span></h3>




          <div class="grdis-about-inf">
            <div class="one-left-ab">

              <p>There are 4 factors that contribute to the value of land within the central land
                are going to be the<br> location <br> size <br>scarcity a<br>popularity <br>
                
                and let's talk about the location of that plot of land and I want to say the location is
                arguably the most important factor that contributes to value for these pieces of land within the decentraland 
                
                lots of land within this metaverse tend to be more valuable when they are located in
                populous areas within the decentraland<br>
                
                if they are located within popular experiences where a lot of people are going to access it as well as a lot of traffic is running through that area
                
                that value of land is most likely to be increased let's hop into the map of the central land and check out some of these plots of land and give you an explanation of what i'm talking about here 
                
                <br>there are specific locations within the central land that are much more
                populous and i have a lot more people entering and interacting with 
                
                <br>for example these green boxes that we're seeing on the map currently are called
                plazas and this is where players respawn
                
                and there's a lot of foot traffic in these areas so land around these areas
                are likely to be more expensive 
                
                <br>than let's say land on the outskirts of the map and these blue plots of land that
                we're seeing right here are called districts which are privately owned
                community pieces of land they are very large and have some very popular
                experiences 
                
                within them and the land surrounding or near these districts
                could possibly be higher in value as well another type of location 
                
                that can contribute to the value of this land.<br> is land that are near these roads that
                we're seeing right here so these roads tend to get a good amount of traffic within them 
                
                because players are walking through these roads constantly so lands that are touching these roads tend to be more expensive than lands that aren't
                
                and as you can see the popularity of a specific location is incredibly important to contributing value to a certain plot of land are 
                
                there a lot of people entering that certain location is there a lot of people looking around
                trying different experiences 
                parcels of land near or on top of these very popular places tend to hold more value
                
                <br>and let's say you want to check out some of the experiences that are currently
                being built near that plot of land you are checking out 
                
                one of the cool things about the decentraland is that 
                the central land is already active and live to be able to be played and people are
                already starting to build on top of it 
                
                <br>so let's say i was interested in this plot of land right here but I first wanted to see the experiences and different type of structures and popularity that is surrounding this area
                
                what i can do is click that plot of land it will pop up a new page for that
                specific parcel of land and what you can do is click here which says jump in and
                that will actually take you inside the central 
                
                and the game so you can take a look at what other experiences are
                building around it so as we've just determined the location of that plot of
                land is very important 
                
                <br>what people want to look for is to make sure that the land is near populous areas as well as
                popular experiences you want to see a lot of traffic running through this specific area because then 
                that plot of land possibly has more value 
                
                let's say the owner of that plot of land wanted to create an experience or game on top of
                it they would then have more people that would possibly be able to be accessing
                that experience 
                
                <br>now moving on the second factor that contributes to the value of
                these pieces of land within the central land is going to be the size <br>
                
               estates are two or more adjacent parcels of land now the larger piece of land
                tends to have more advantages than a smaller piece of land
                
                you're able to create more experiences and different interactions within that piece of land because there's more room to build on so the value of larger pieces of land tend to be more expensive
                than a single pot of land 
                
                and honestly there's not that much more to explain here just think of it like i've said
                before 
                <br>
                
                bigger is usually always better i mean let's just compare this single plot
                of land to this giant estate that's over here the owner of this estate will obviously be able to build a larger and more in-depth experience than the single plot of land 
                
                and not only does that contribute to the value of that piece of land but it possibly could create a
                better experience that allows for better income generation for the owner by the
                way if you're not doing 
                
                <br>now moving on we're going to talk about the final two factors that contribute to the value of these pieces of land within the central land 
                
                and that's going to be scarcity and the popularity of the game <br>
                
                these two things coincide with one another as we stated before there's only 90 601
                parcels of land in the central land 
                
                and <br>if the popularity of the game continues to grow the demand for these plots of land will increase now one thing to note the 90 601 parcels of land in decentraland is currently capped off at that point at the moment 
                
                but there could be a point in the future when the game grows exponentially that players within
                this game may want to add more plots of land for the specific metaverse 
                
                
                
                </p>
